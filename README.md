# PH3310 - Final Year Physics Project

Welcome to my final year physics project for my BSc degree in Physics with Philosophy at Royal Holloway University of London.

## Project Overview

### Report

I've created a comprehensive scientific report using LaTeX and Mathematica, focusing on the spread of COVID-19 in the UK, London and the Local area of Runnymede. In this report, I applied various mathematical models to understand and predict the spread of the virus. Two key modeling approaches I utilized are:

1. **Exponential Spread Modeling**: I explored how COVID-19 spreads exponentially, which is a fundamental aspect of infectious disease modeling.

2. **Avrami Equation**: I applied the Avrami equation which is used to describe the kinetics of crystallization and phase transformation. While it's commonly used in materials science, I demonstrated its applicability to the spread of infectious diseases.

### Presentation

To complement the report, I've also prepared a PowerPoint presentation. This presentation provides a concise overview of the project's key findings, methodologies, and conclusions. You can refer to it for a quick summary of the research.

### Poster

In addition to the report and presentation, I've designed an informative poster. The poster presents key insights from the project in a visually engaging format. It's a great resource for conveying the project's main takeaways.

Feel free to explore the report, presentation, and poster to gain a deeper understanding of the COVID-19 spread modeling and the application of the Avrami equation.

If you have any questions or would like to discuss this project further, please don't hesitate to contact me.

Thank you for visiting!
